## Overview

`godoc-mcp` is a MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation in Go. It allows any LLM that supports MCP to use go docs to understand a Go project.  This helps reduce the tokens needed to understand a project. This server can be used in combination with MCP servers that can read entire files to give LLMs both high level and detailed information about a project.

This workflow significantly reduces the number of tokens needed to work with Go projects in particular, and allows LLMs to work with much larger projects.
